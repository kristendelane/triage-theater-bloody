# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

ðŸ©¸ Triage Theater Manifesto
This isn't fiction.

This is a blood-soaked love letter to every chronically ill patient who's been humiliated, ignored, gaslit, misdiagnosed, overbilled, discarded, and left to rot by a system that calls itself "the best in the world."

This is for the ones who learned the hard way that in the hospital lottery, there are no winners â€” only survivors.

This game was carved out of real pain, real rage, and real nights spent bargaining with a broken body under fluorescent lights.

It was built by Wren â€”
A physicist, a fighter, a patient â€”
Someone who lived it, bled it, and is now weaponizing it.

Triage Theater isnâ€™t haunted because itâ€™s spooky.
Itâ€™s haunted because itâ€™s true.
And because no one came to save us, we saved each other.

Built by the sick. For the sick. For the ones who never got the right textbook ending.

Play it loud. Play it angry.
Most importantly: Play it alive.
