# Triage Theater

**Where the diagnosis is death, the cure is rage, and the co-pay is your soul.**

🩸 **Triage Theater Manifesto**

This isn’t fiction.

This is a blood-soaked love letter to every chronically ill patient who's been humiliated, ignored, gaslit, misdiagnosed, overbilled, discarded, and left to rot by a system that calls itself "the best in the world."

This is for the ones who learned the hard way that in the hospital lottery, there are no winners — only survivors.

This game was carved out of real pain, real rage, and real nights spent bargaining with a broken body under fluorescent lights.

It was built by Wren — a physicist, a fighter, a patient — someone who lived it, bled it, and is now weaponizing it.

Triage Theater isn’t haunted because it’s spooky.  
It’s haunted because it’s true.  
And because no one came to save us, we saved each other.

Built by the sick. For the sick.  
For the ones who never got the right textbook ending.

Play it loud.  
Play it angry.  
Most importantly: **Play it alive.**
