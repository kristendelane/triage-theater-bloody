      Dr. Amal is 33 years old. Young enough to glow with arrogance, old enough to know better. But her brilliance is surface-deep ‚Äî a mind made of bullet points and borrowed protocols.

      She rounds on you with two ducklings in tow, neither old enough to rent a car.

      Your abdomen is bloated. Your pain is at a 9. You haven‚Äôt peed in 18 hours.

      "Your vitals are stable. We‚Äôll discharge you today. Try drinking more fluids. We don‚Äôt see a surgical issue here."

      She signs the chart, smiles like it's a favor, and disappears.

      What do you do?

      * [[Stay silent. Let it happen.->Silent]]
      * [[Stand up and demand imaging.->Demand]]
    </tw-passagedata>

    <tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Plead">
      She scribbles "anxious affect" in your chart.  
      "If we listen to every sob story, we‚Äôll never get anything done."

      You‚Äôre sent home with a stack of papers and no antiemetics.  
      You vomit blood two hours after discharge.  
      You collapse three days later, seizing and aspirating on your own bile in the bathroom.  
      Your partner finds you blue, pulseless, and brain-dead.

      Machines keep your body alive for two days. Dr. Amal never calls back.

    </tw-passagedata>

    <tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Silent">
      You‚Äôre discharged with the words ‚Äúmedically stable‚Äù echoing like a death knell.

      You try to manage at home. On day two, your abdomen balloons.  
      You call the ER. They suggest urgent care.  
      You die in your sleep from peritonitis. Alone. In your own bed.

      The coroner writes: ‚ÄúDeath by preventable neglect.‚Äù  
      The hospital seals the file.

    <tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Demand">
      Security is called. You‚Äôre labeled ‚Äúaggressive.‚Äù  
      They shove Ativan through your IV.  
      You don‚Äôt remember leaving the hospital.

      You wake up in a psych hold.  
      Labs were never run.  
      You code in the holding cell from sepsis.

    </tw-passagedata>

    <tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Scene 2 Choices">
      Dr. Amal gets a call from Risk Management. Your name rings a bell.

      She Googles your obituary while eating a salad.  
      She winces ‚Äî but only because the photo is unflattering.

      "Case closed. Patient noncompliant."

      But that pain under her ribs? It's growing.

      What does she do next?

      * [[Push through. Patients come first.->IgnorePain]]
      * [[Make a quick appointment with her favorite GI.->GIDismissal]]
      * [[Go to urgent care anonymously.->UrgentCareIgnored]]
    </tw-passagedata>
  
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="IgnorePain">
  She doubles her clinic hours and cancels her own labs.  
  The pain gets worse. Her assistant asks if she‚Äôs okay.  
  Amal barks, ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù No one asks again.

  One night, she vomits mid-consult.  
  A nurse offers to call someone. Amal refuses.

  She collapses during rounds, hitting her head on a vitals cart.

  [[Collapse leads to shared room->Scene3_AmalDies]]
</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="GIDismissal">
  She books a visit with Dr. Myles ‚Äî someone she‚Äôs referred to for years.  
  He smiles like he knows better. ‚ÄúProbably stress. You‚Äôve always overextended.‚Äù

  He doesn't touch her.  
  Notes say: ‚ÄúAppears anxious, no acute findings.‚Äù

  Amal stares at the wall while waiting for test orders. None come.

  She leaves with a prescription for Pepcid and shame.

  Three weeks later, she‚Äôs admitted through the ER after collapsing at Whole Foods.

  [[Admitted to hallway hell->Scene3_AmalDies]]
</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="UrgentCareIgnored">
  She registers anonymously to avoid bias.  
  The PA guesses: ‚ÄúMaybe gallbladder? Maybe not.‚Äù

  She waits six hours without triage.  
  Her vitals are never checked.

  She hears her name mispronounced over the intercom. ‚ÄúAl-mall?‚Äù  
  Then they skip her entirely.

  She stumbles out, dizzy and ignored.  
  Collapses at home. Paramedics take her to her old hospital.

  [[And they don‚Äôt recognize her.->Scene3_AmalDies]]
</tw-passagedata>


<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Scene3_AmalDies">
  She‚Äôs placed in a shared room ‚Äî a windowless corner meant for ‚Äúoverflow.‚Äù

  Her roommate? A woman Amal once called ‚Äúnon-urgent.‚Äù  
  That woman smiles and presses her call light every hour ‚Äî for both of them. No one comes.

  Amal‚Äôs gown is soaked with bile.  
  A junior resident charts ‚Äúpatient appears stable, resting‚Äù without entering the room.

  * [[Try to flag the nurse.->IgnoredToDeath]]
  * [[Text her old team. No one replies.->GhostedToDeath]]
  * [[Lie still, invisible.->AloneAndErased]]
</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="10" name="IgnoredToDeath">
  A tech tells her, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be back with pain meds.‚Äù They never return.

  At 2:13 AM, she codes.  
  It takes 12 minutes before anyone notices.

  Her chart reads: ‚ÄúManipulative behavior observed. Delay in care appropriate.‚Äù

  [[Final Report->Postmortem]]
</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="11" name="GhostedToDeath">
  She texts five colleagues. No response.  
  One replies after her death with ‚ÄúWho dis?‚Äù

  She codes during shift change.  
  Her roommate watches, whispering: ‚ÄúNow you understand.‚Äù

  [[Final Report->Postmortem]]
</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="AloneAndErased">
  She closes her eyes and thinks of her med school honors ceremony.

  Her body is cold before the rapid response arrives.  
  The crash cart has no working defib leads.

  The last note on her chart says ‚ÄúPatient sleeping.‚Äù

  [[Final Report->Postmortem]]
</tw-passagedata>

<tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Postmortem">
  Her body is wheeled to the basement morgue and mislabeled.

  Her voicemail leaks:  
  > ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have time for another psych case. Just discharge her.‚Äù

  üßæ Headline: ‚ÄúDoctor Dies of Neglect in Same Hospital She Once Ruled.‚Äù

  TikTok trend: **#AmalEffect**

  She is removed from her department‚Äôs website.  
  Her research is retracted.  
  Her license revoked posthumously.
